# Description
I have created an online weather application for users to search a city and get today's current weather. The weather application will display temperature in Fahrenheit, Wind, and humidity percentage. The next five days of weather will also be displayed for the same city searched in the search bar displaying the dates on top of each section. 

## Installation
There is no installation needed to access this Weather Application. It is available on the internet through the following link: 

## Usage
The user can type the city name in the search, press the "search" button. This will immediately display the current day and next five day's weather information. The user can refresh the page to search for another city.
